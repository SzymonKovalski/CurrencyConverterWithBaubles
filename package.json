When the chess piece moves to the bottom of the opponent's board, it becomes the king.\r 4. as you’ll see，kings can also move backwards.\r 5. A piece may only move one square unless it is making a jump.\r # How to play ?\r Black moves first. Players take turns moving one checker per turn. A piece can move one space sideways,forward, or diagonally towards the opposing home space. It CANNOT move backwards towards it own home space.(Kings can, as you’ll see.)![截屏2021-05-18 上午10 45 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74135859/118621847-6f65fc00-b7cf-11eb-8038-a95b537ee9fa.png)\r # WINNING !\r A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. Usually, this is because all of the opponent’s pieces have been captured, but sometimes it is because the opponent has no space to move onto (he is “blocked” from moving).\r # DEMO\r [Checkers]()",
